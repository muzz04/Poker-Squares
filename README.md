Optimal Greedy Algorithm:
The approach used is the greedy algorithm in Monte Carlo fashion. The grid was broken into hands for each row and column and then evaluated using each of the rules to find the hands contained in them. Based on the implementation, Monte Carlo search guided by optimized greedy was determined to be the most effective approach.
